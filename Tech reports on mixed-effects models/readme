Attached are files with SAS and R programs that were made available in supplemental material for our Stat in Medicine paper (2019 and 2021) and our Biometrics paper (2022). The primary directory has two subdirectories: one for the two Stat in Medicine papers with programs and one for the Biometrics paper with the R and SAS programs used for our simulations. The original publications are included as well in the hope that readers will consult the papers before using the programs.
  
The Correction to the Stat in Medicine paper explains corrections made to the two SAS programs submitted with the original Stat in Medicine paper but which we amended in the Correction paper to correct some minor issues with both programs. The SAS programs are published but with no actual datasets except for the MDRD-B Study which was included, with permission, to use in the lead author's SAS book. Anyone can get access to the MDRD-B study via my SAS Author page: https://support.sas.com/en/books/authors/edward-vonesh.html.
